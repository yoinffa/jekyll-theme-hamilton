# Research Experiences
### Project1 *(Jan. 2017 - Dec. 2020)*  
**Research on the shared genetic mechanisms of hypertension and type 2 diabetes based on molecular network data mining** - *National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81660075)*
- **Description:** This research project investigates the shared genetic variants between primary hypertension and type 2 diabetes, employing molecular network construction and GWAS data analysis methodologies. Our findings reveal the association of polymorphisms of rs458710 on CSNK2A1 and rs2286674 on PRKCA with the phenotype of combined type 2 diabetes and hypertension, using an unconditional logistic regression model. Notably, both genes exhibit enrichment within the Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, we observe significant associations between variants in CSNK2A1, PRKCA, and RKCA and various clinical traits in patients affected by both hypertension and type 2 diabetes, including BMI and weight
- **Contribution:** Genetic association analysis, Construction of patient information database, Data quality control, statistical analysis, and data visualization (Manhattan plots, QQ plots, and protein-protein interaction network plots etc.)

### Project2 *(Jan. 2020 - Dec. 2023)*  
**Study on the regulatory mechanism of NHE in proximal tubule epithelial cells based on molecular network analysis of renal sympathetic nervous system and RAAS crosstalk** - *National Natural Science Foundation of
China (No. 81960087)*  
- **Description:** This study explores the roles of the crosstalk between the renal sympathetic nervous system and the
RAAS system on the regulatory mechanism of sodium-hydrogen exchangers (NHE) in proximal tubular cells. We
have preliminarily confirmed the upregulation effect of the beta2-adrenergic receptor/GRK2/ARRB1 pathway on
NHE3 activity
- **Contribution:** Experimental protocol design, Cell experiment, Molecular experiment, pHi recovery rate measurement
(for the detection of NHE3 activity) etc.
