# Self Introduction
&nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Yongfa Dai. I graduated from Guangxi Medical University two years ago and am currently working in the cardiovascular department at the First People's Hospital of Nanning City. My main interest lies in bioinformatic analysis. I have acquired proficient skills in **R**, **Python**, **Perl languages**, as well as **shell programming** on Linux for bioinformatics data analysis. Throughout my Master's degree program, I actively participated in two national projects funded by the **National Natural Science Foundation of China** (Nos. 81660075 and Nos. 81960087). In these projects, I made significant contributions to experimental design, implementation, and bioinformatics data analysis. My responsibilities encompassed both upstream and downstream data analyses for **GWAS**, **RNA-seq**, **Single-cell RNA-Seq**, in addition to performing molecular and cell experiments. Moreover, I hold the designation of an **Advanced Technical Engineer** of **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation**. I possess the ability to simulate the hemodynamic characteristics of various cardiovascular disease models, including ascending aortic dilation, atrial fibrillation, aortic valve stenosis, and more.
