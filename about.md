&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm a postgraduate student majoring in cardiology. I am interested in bioinformatic analyses. I have proficiently mastered **R**, **Python**, **Perl languages**, and **shell programming on Linux** for bioinformatics. I have participated in two projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (**Nos. 81660075** and **Nos. 81960087**), mainly engaging in experimental design, implementation, and data analysis. The research content includes **GWAS**, **RNA-seq**, **Single-cell RNA-Seq**, and **intracellular pH (pHi) measurement**. Additionally, during my work, I obtained the Advanced Technical Engineer Certificate in **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** simulation, issued by the Chinese Academy of Management Science. I hope I can do something for your project jos jobs.
