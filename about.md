# SELF INTRODUCTION
&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm a postgraduate student majoring in cardiology. I am interested in bioinformatic analyses. I have proficiently mastered **R**, **Python**, **Perl languages**, and **shell programming on Linux** for bioinformatics data anlysis. During my Master's degree program, I participated in two national projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (**Nos. 81660075** and **Nos. 81960087**), mainly engaging in experimental design, implementation, and bioinformatics data analysis. The research content includes **GWAS**, **RNA-seq**, **Single-cell RNA-Seq**, and **intracellular pH (pHi) measurement**. Additionally, I am Advanced Technical Engineer of **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** simulation. I can simulate the hemodynamic characteristics of many cardiovascular diseases model, such as ascending aortic dilation, atrial fibrillation, aortic valve stenosis, etc.
